# Game Theory and Imperfect Information Approaches

## Foundational Game Theory for Imperfect Information Games

### Games with Imperfect Information (Blair et al., 1993)
**Fundamental Theoretical Results**:
- **Complexity Result**: Single-player imperfect information games are NP-complete
- **Implication**: Must seek special cases or heuristics for computational tractability
- **Contribution**: Efficient algorithm for special cases of imperfect information games
- **Application**: Heuristic algorithms for general case using special-case solutions

### Finding Optimal Strategies (Frank & Basin, 1998)  
**Core Problem**: Search in imperfect information games fundamentally different from perfect information
- **Monte Carlo Analysis**: Showed probability of finding optimal strategy approaches zero as tree size increases
- **Complexity**: Proved underlying optimization problem is NP-complete
- **Heuristics**: Developed polynomial-time heuristics (vector minimax, payoff-reduction minimax)
- **Bridge Results**: First game-general algorithm achieving expert-level performance on bridge problems

## Multi-Agent Cooperation Frameworks

### Joint Policy Search (Multi-agent Collaboration, NeurIPS 2020)
**Innovation**: Joint policy optimization for cooperative imperfect information games
- **Key Concept**: Policy-change density for quantifying impact of policy modifications
- **Theory**: Local policy changes can be evaluated using sum of local policy-change densities  
- **Guarantee**: Tabular case guarantees policy changes only improve performance
- **Application**: Successfully applied to bridge bidding phase
- **Limitation**: Bridge comparison with WBridge5 noted as "slightly unfair"

### Learning Multi-Agent Implicit Communication (Tian et al., 2018)
**Focus**: Communication through actions in collaborative imperfect-information games
- **Algorithm**: Policy-Belief-Iteration (P-BIT)
- **Dual Objectives**:
  1. Infer meaning behind partner's actions  
  2. Balance exploitation vs. information conveyance in own actions
- **Case Study**: Contract bridge as testbed for implicit communication learning
- **Innovation**: Models both components of human collaboration under uncertainty

- **Information Theory**: Quantifying information transfer through bidding sequences
- **Decision Theory**: Optimal decisions under uncertainty with incomplete information
- **Cooperative Game Theory**: Partnership strategies in competitive environment

## Information Set Analysis

### Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS)
**Theoretical Foundation**: Search trees of information sets rather than game states
- **Advantage**: Directly analyzes true game structure under imperfect information
- **Algorithm Variants**: Three different ISMCTS algorithms for different uncertainty sources
- **Bridge Application**: Successfully handles both hidden cards and uncertain opponent actions
- **Commercial Success**: Proven in commercial game implementations

### Strategy Fusion and Non-Locality Solutions
**Core Problems in Bridge AI**:

#### Strategy Fusion
- **Problem**: AI uses different strategies for same information set across samples
- **Impact**: Creates impossible-to-execute mixed strategies
- **Solutions**: αμ search, EPIMC, Recursive Monte Carlo approaches

#### Non-Locality  
- **Problem**: Node values depend on information external to subtree
- **Impact**: Makes deep search computationally intractable
- **Solutions**: Partition search, lattice-based alpha-beta extensions

## Assumptions in Game Theory Literature

1. **Rationality**: All players play optimally according to game-theoretic principles
2. **Common Knowledge**: Rules and payoffs are known to all players
3. **Nash Equilibrium**: Solution concept assumes equilibrium play
4. **Perfect Recall**: Players remember all previous information and actions
5. **Stationarity**: Game structure and strategies don't evolve during play

## Computational Complexity Results

### Theoretical Barriers
- **NP-Completeness**: Even single-player imperfect information games are NP-complete
- **EXPTIME-Complete**: Multi-player games with imperfect information  
- **Space Complexity**: Information set sizes grow exponentially with game length
- **Sample Complexity**: Monte Carlo methods require exponential samples for convergence

### Practical Implications
- **Approximation Necessity**: Exact solutions computationally intractable for bridge
- **Heuristic Development**: Must develop problem-specific heuristics and approximations
- **Real-Time Constraints**: Tournament play requires solutions in seconds, not minutes
- **Memory Limitations**: Full game trees exceed available computational resources
